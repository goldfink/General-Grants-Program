# 30k Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Dwitter Censorship resistant Web3 Microblogging and Social Networking service

## Project Overview 
The projects servers a web3 replacement of Twitter, which has become the Internet standard for 330 active users engaging in the creation of content as well as social interaction, political and journalistic review, news coverage and diplomatic representation between countries. The platform has made it easy to pursue these means of communication using centralized instrastructure and services owned and operated by Twitter Inc. -- Parity's mission of launching the web3 in a decentralized manner aligns with the idea of including a version of the platform that relies on technology such as Polkadot human readable names and IPFS for self-hosted user content, providing uncensorable social content entirely in the users control.

### Overview

  * [[Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama Integration]] Dwitter provides a Polkadot Parachain for human readable names in a decentralized platform, as well as social currency exchange between users.
  * [[Team]] The team is experienced in cryptographic technology, distributed systems and shares the security community's and Parity's mission on decentralization.
    It serves experience in international entrepreneurship and is engaged in the security community. Open source value for a web3 and a more open and decentralized     Internet has been and is being created.

### Project Details 
The final state of the project renders a Website on Public DNS or browser supported crypto domains, as well as multiple clients for mobile and desktop usage. The user interfaces serves an intuitive frontend proxying social media funcitonality through censorship resistant and purposefully web3 proven Tor hidden services, IPFS/IPNS for user-controlled content delivery and a Polkadot parachain, rendering currency and human readable names.

The UI mimics the Twitter.com user experience with additional features. 
[[MISSING: *  Mockups/designs of any UI components]]
[[MISSING: *  API specifications of the core functionality]]
[[MISSING: *  An overview of the technology stack to be used]]
[[MISSING: *  Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed]]
* PoC: https://github.com/iohzrd/follow

### Ecosystem Fit 
The Ecosystem fit is proven by purpose, integration of the Polkadot Stack and architectural censorship resistant design of the project. The AutoDapp project seems to align https://raymondcheng.net/projects/decentralization/autodapp-proposal.html with the web3 mission as well.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $100k.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** $5,000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
